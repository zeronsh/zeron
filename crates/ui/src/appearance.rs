//! Light/dark switching: what the user asked for, what the OS reports, and the
//! plumbing that turns a change in either into a repaint.
//!
//! Three pieces, following the pattern zed uses (`crates/theme/src/theme.rs`
//! `SystemAppearance` + `reload_theme` + `cx.refresh_windows`):
//!
//! 1. [`AppearanceMode`] — the persisted user choice: follow the OS, or pin one.
//! 2. [`AppearanceState`] — a gpui global holding that choice alongside the last
//!    appearance the OS reported, so [`resolve`] can combine them.
//! 3. [`observe_window`] — subscribes to the platform's appearance notification
//!    (macOS `viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance`) and re-applies.
//!
//! # Why `refresh_windows` and not `notify`
//!
//! Colors are read *imperatively* (`Theme::of(cx).text`) at paint time, not
//! through a reactive binding, so no view knows its colors went stale — a
//! `notify()` on some entity would repaint that entity and nothing else.
//! [`App::refresh_windows`] marks every window dirty *and* disables gpui's
//! per-view prepaint cache for the frame, which is the only thing that forces
//! already-laid-out elements to re-run their paint with the new palette.
