//! ChatClient — WebSocket transport for chat2 rooms (docs/chat2-sync.md C1):
//! hello/state handshake with client-side checkpoint precision, cursor-based
//! row backfill, push/ack with a pending-unacked queue, opaque presence
//! relay, probe/redial liveness, and reconnect with exponential backoff.
//!
//! The client owns no CRDT semantics: update bytes flow through a
//! [`ChatDocSink`] the engine implements over its `ChatDocHandle` (import +
//! persist doc AND cursor in one transaction — the C2 rule). Wire frames are
//! the binary chat2 codec ([`crate::chat_frames`]), byte-compatible with
//! `edge/src/chat-frames.ts`.
//!
//! Liveness discipline is inherited from `registry.rs` and its incidents:
//! transport pings prove nothing about the DO; room health is judged only by
//! protocol frames with probe deadlines.
