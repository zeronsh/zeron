//! Suspend/resume detection without OS hooks — wake is an EVENT, not a
//! timeout.
//!
//! A 1s ticker compares wall-clock elapsed to monotonic elapsed since the
//! previous tick. Monotonic clocks (macOS `mach_absolute_time`, Linux
//! `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`) exclude suspend, so a wall jump far beyond the tick
//! means the process just woke from system sleep. Subscribers — room actors,
//! relay links, the token refresh loop — reconnect/refresh immediately
//! instead of discovering half-open sockets by silence-lease timeout
//! (Discord/Slack-style instant recovery; user report: "doesn't fix until I
//! restart the app" / "shouldn't take a minute").
//!
//! The detector task is a lazily-spawned process-wide singleton; `subscribe`
//! must first be called from within a tokio runtime (every caller is an
//! async context). Broadcast receivers that lag simply miss duplicate wake
//! events — each subscriber treats ANY received event as "reconnect now",
//! so a missed one is at worst covered by the next silence lease.
