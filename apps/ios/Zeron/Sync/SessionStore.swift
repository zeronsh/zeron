// Session doc mirror — transcript entries + the durable command queue for one
// chat (crates/doc/src/schema.rs), synced over the chat2 log relay
// (docs/chat2-sync.md; s2 is dead on mobile). A viewer device never writes
// message entries; it appends command ledger entries (rule 1) and lets the
// host drain them. Optimistic echo: pending sends render locally under their
// client-minted message id until the host writes the real entry with the
// same id.
//
// The registry names the room generation (M2): the store connects only once
// the chat row says roomGen 2. A gen-1 chat renders nothing and waits for
// the host's migration sweep to flip it — the local doc is always the chat2
// lineage; a cached pre-chat2 snapshot is never imported (unrelated Loro
// histories would duplicate every message), only mined for our own pending
// commands (M3) and left on disk as rollback.
