// chat2 room client — a Swift port of crates/sync/src/chat_client.rs, the
// binary-frame sibling of RegistryClient. One WebSocket per chat to
// /chat2/{chatId}/ws: hello/state handshake with client-side checkpoint
// precision (the frontier payload decides fetch-vs-skip), cursor-based row
// backfill, push/ack with a pending-unacked batch queue, probe/redial
// liveness, reconnect with exponential backoff.
//
// The client owns no CRDT semantics: update bytes flow through main-actor
// delegate closures into SessionStore's doc, which persists doc content AND
// the room cursor in one file write (the C2 rule — they can never diverge).
//
// Liveness discipline is inherited from the registry client and its
// incidents: the text "ping" elicits a runtime auto-pong that proves NOTHING
// about the DO, so room health is judged only by protocol frames against
// hard deadlines.
