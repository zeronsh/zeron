# Zeron for iOS

A UIKit viewport onto the zeron mesh, built on the Rust mobile core. The phone
is a **peer device**: it mirrors the workspace registry, joins per-chat session
rooms, and drives remote engines through the durable command ledger. No agent
runs on the phone.

**Rust decides what to paint and where; Swift paints, scrolls and handles
gestures.** Everything in Rust is platform-neutral — the future Android app
links the same library. See [`docs/mobile-rewrite.md`](../../docs/mobile-rewrite.md).

## Build & run

Requires Xcode 26+ and a Rust toolchain with the iOS targets:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
cd apps/ios
xcodebuild -project Zeron.xcodeproj -scheme Zeron \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

The Zeron target's **Rust core** build phase runs `scripts/ios/build-core.sh`,
which builds `crates/mobile` for the active platform (always optimized — the
`mobile` cargo profile) and refreshes the committed UniFFI bindings in
`Zeron/Core/Generated/`. `ZERON_SKIP_CORE=1` reuses the last built library
when iterating on Swift only.

## Layout

```
Zeron/
  App/         AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, AppModel (owns CoreClient; maps
               workspace snapshots to view models; Keychain credentials)
  Core/        Generated UniFFI bindings; Fonts (the exact bytes Rust measures,
               registered with CoreText) + CoreText fallback measurer
  Design/      Palette (color roles → light/dark), Glass helpers, DotGridView,
               brand marks
  Transcript/  TranscriptListView (virtualized scroll host over LayoutFrame),
               RowView/RowModel (CoreText painter for Rust display lists,
               streaming veil), FrameRelay
  Session/     SessionViewController, SessionSource (Core/Fixture), new-session
               canvas
  Composer/    ComposerBar (glass capsule, send/queue/steer/stop), question and
               queue panels, attachment picker
  Threads/     Sessions/folders/PRs/search lists, Projects groups, cells
  Shell/       Tab bar (+ search tab, "Ask anything" accessory), More, sign-in
  Debug/       Transcript lab + hitch meter
```

### Transcript pipeline

1. `zeron-client` applies session-doc updates incrementally (O(changed
   entries)) and publishes immutable snapshots.
2. `TranscriptView.attach(client, chatId)` subscribes **in Rust**; the layout
   thread turns entries into rows (one per markdown block / user message / tool
   group), reparses streaming markdown incrementally, and measures every row
   with `zeron-text` at the viewport width.
3. Each pass publishes a `LayoutFrame`: exact heights + prefix-sum offsets.
   `rowsIn(y0, y1)` is a binary search; `display(i)` builds a display list
   (text runs at exact positions, boxes, links, scrollers, widgets).
4. `TranscriptListView` positions reusable `RowView`s at those offsets and
   paints runs with CoreText at the Rust coordinates — measurement and
   rendering can't disagree. Display models for rows beyond the viewport are
   prefetched off the main thread.

## Launch arguments

| Arg | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-demo` | Offline demo workspace (Rust `DemoHost`: registry, docs, streaming replies) |
| `-fast` / `-longreply` | Demo stream speed / reply length |
| `-big` / `-huge` | Demo transcripts with 120 / 600 turns |
| `-route chat:<id>` / `new` / `projects` / `prs` / `more` / `search` | Open a screen at launch |
| `-signedout` | Clear stored credentials |
| `-dev <userId> <orgId> [-edge <url>]` | Dev bearer against an `AUTH_MODE=dev` edge (e.g. `wrangler dev`) |
| `-lab [-turns N] [-autostream] [-autoscroll] [-top] [-meter]` | Transcript lab over fixture markdown, with an on-screen hitch meter |

## Tests

```sh
# Rust
cargo test -p zeron-text -p zeron-markdown -p zeron-client -p zeron-mobile
cargo test --release -p zeron-mobile --lib bench_layout -- --ignored --nocapture

# Line-break accuracy vs CoreText (same font bytes), flows, hitch benchmarks
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronTests/LineBreakAccuracyTests test
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronUITests/SessionFlowTests test
xcodebuild … -only-testing:ZeronUITests/ScrollPerformanceTests test
```

## TestFlight release

Run the **TestFlight** workflow from GitHub Actions on `main`. It installs the
Rust iOS targets, compiles the app and tests, selects the next build number
from App Store Connect, archives with automatic signing, and uploads an
internal TestFlight build. Secrets: `AC_API_KEY_P8`, `AC_API_KEY_ID`,
`AC_API_ISSUER_ID`.
