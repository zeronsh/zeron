# Zeron for iOS

A native SwiftUI viewport onto the zeron mesh. The phone is a **peer
device**: it joins the same Loro CRDT rooms as every other device (workspace
doc + per-chat session docs over the edge's Durable Objects), renders the
mirrors, and drives remote engines through the durable command queue. No
engine runs on the phone.

## Build & run

Requires Xcode 26+ (iOS 26 SDK — Liquid Glass APIs).

```sh
cd apps/ios
xcodebuild -project Zeron.xcodeproj -scheme Zeron \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

Or open `Zeron.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run. Dependencies (SPM, resolved
automatically): [loro-swift 1.13.x](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-swift)
(matches the engine's loro 1.13), [swift-markdown](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-markdown)
(cmark-gfm: tables/strikethrough/tasklists — the same feature set as the
desktop's pulldown-cmark config).

## TestFlight release

Run the **TestFlight** workflow from GitHub Actions on `main`. It compiles the
iOS app and tests, selects the next numeric build number from App Store
Connect, archives with automatic signing, uploads an internal-only TestFlight
build, and waits for Apple processing to report `VALID`.

The workflow uses the `AC_API_KEY_P8`, `AC_API_KEY_ID`, and
`AC_API_ISSUER_ID` repository secrets.

### Connecting

- **WorkOS**: enter the edge URL, open the sign-in page on any device, paste
  the code it shows (`/auth/exchange`), pick an org (`/auth/refresh` re-scopes
  the token with the `org_id` claim).
- **Dev**: against an `AUTH_MODE=dev` edge (e.g. `wrangler dev`), enter a user
  id + org id; the bearer is `userId@orgId`.
- **Demo mode**: fully offline dataset with a scripted streaming reply —
  explore the UI with no infrastructure. Launch args for screenshot rigs:
  `-demo [-route chat:<id>|space:<id>] [-stream]`.

### Sessions without a project

Home's **+ → Session without a project…** opens the execution-device picker,
including when the account has no projects. Choose a desktop host (offline
hosts are allowed); the draft shows **No project** and the host name. Tap the
host above the composer to change it before sending. Catalogs and attachment
delivery use that host, and Git/ref/worktree controls are hidden.

Creation uses the same local registry outbox and durable session command
ledger as project sessions: `spaceId` is omitted, `deviceId` names the selected
host, `cwd` is `"~"`, and `roomGen` is `2`. Home's **All** list includes these
sessions, including ones synchronized from desktop. A project filter excludes
them. Active sessions pointing to a deleted/missing project remain hidden;
the archived shelf retains its existing behavior.

Regression coverage lives in `ProjectlessSessionTests` (registry persistence,
incoming desktop rows, destination selection, configuration and first command)
and `ProjectlessSessionUITests` (create/send/reopen, empty accounts, host changes,
project filters and the existing project flow). Run on an Xcode 26+ Mac:

```sh
cd apps/ios
xcodebuild -project Zeron.xcodeproj -scheme Zeron \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:ZeronTests/ProjectlessSessionTests \
  -only-testing:ZeronUITests/ProjectlessSessionUITests test
```

Demo fixtures accept `-no-projects` (empty spaces/chats), `-ios-only` (no
execution hosts), and `-sethomefilter <spaceId>` (an empty value selects All).

### Parity notes (desktop ⇄ mobile translations)

| Desktop | iOS |
| --- | --- |
| Sidebar: Spaces + attention-sorted Sessions | Home screen sections (same sort ranks: awaiting > errored > working > completed > idle) |
| Horizontal session tabs per space | Space detail: vertical session list (creation order) |
| Tab close = archive | Swipe-to-archive |
| Archived shelf under the sidebar list (open by default, Show-more paging, hover-swap Unarchive) | Same shelf under Home/space lists; unarchive is swipe-to-unarchive |
| Status word in the row corner (muted dots; Done keeps its pop; spinner rides bottom-right) | Same, same colors |
| Composer `white_alpha(0.03)` pill + hairline | Liquid Glass pill (`glassEffect`) + hairline |
| Harness brand SVG marks (icons.rs) | Same path data via a native SVG path parser (`BrandMarks.swift`) |
| Harness/model picker popover + curated catalogs | Brand-mark cards + catalog menu + reasoning-ladder chips (`HarnessCatalog.swift`, ported from crates/harness) |
| Add-space palette (device + folder browser) | New-space sheet: device tabs + remote folder browser (ListFolders over the device-room relay, git repos badged) |
| ControlRpc over device-room relay | `DeviceRelayClient` — binary `uleb128(len)+header+payload` frames, `{"s","k","to","from"}` header, ndjson ControlRpc; used for ListFolders + direct-to-host `Mutate {createSpace}` (local doc-write fallback when the host is offline) |
| Hover timestamps / copy | Context menus |
| Long user messages: Show more / Show less | Five-line preview, 44pt disclosure target, expansion retained per session |
| gpui `list()` sum-tree virtualization | Native table row reuse with SwiftUI content, stable row ids and version fingerprints |
| Stick-to-bottom spring, wheel-up breaks pin | Gesture-owned follow, composer-sized viewport with glass underlap, retained local prompt runway |

Status colors, font families, veil timing, command-ledger shapes, and wire
protocol follow desktop. Text sizes and touch targets are adapted for phones;
see [mobile polish and simulator coverage](../../docs/mobile-polish.md).

### Writer discipline (what the phone writes)

- Workspace registry: chat creates (host = the project's owning device or
  the explicitly selected projectless host), `archived`/`title`/`lastSeenAt`
  LWW sets, presence heartbeats. The phone owns no engine device row.
- Session docs: append commands (`run`/`steer`/`interrupt`/`respondInput`)
  with client-minted message ids for optimistic echo; add and reorder shared
  queue rows. Queue edits and removals require host acknowledgement. The host
  writes all transcript entries and command outcomes.
- After queuing a command it POSTs `/device/{host}/nudge` so a cold host
  opens the doc and drains — delivery stays durable in the doc regardless.

### Shared message queue

Messages submitted during an active turn use the host's shared queue when it
advertises support. The composer toolbar's **Queue / Steer** menu persists the
phone's preference; **Queue** remains the default. Steer allows automatic
mid-turn delivery when the provider supports it. Attachments wait for a turn
that can accept files.

Rows offer **Steer** for a host-advertised mid-turn provider and text-only
messages, or **Send now** (interrupt) otherwise. Unknown provider capabilities
leave delivery actions unavailable. Edits require a host lease; removal waits
for the host's acknowledgement and keeps the row inert while pending. Failed
or unconfirmed actions show an error above the composer and trigger sync repair.
Deleting an actively edited row discards it without first releasing its lease.

With an external keyboard, **Command+Return** submits the draft (including
attachment-only drafts), saves an active queue edit, or activates the first
queued row when the composer is empty. It never skips a blocked head or stops
the agent merely because the draft is empty.

Queue editing on iOS changes text only and preserves queued attachments, including when the text is cleared. Draft photos are hidden and the attachment picker is unavailable during editing. If the row disappears or its lease is superseded, **Copy edit and stop editing** saves the edited text to the clipboard and restores the original draft and photos.
