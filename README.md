## Desktop app

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zeronsh/zeron/releases/latest):

- **macOS** — `zeron-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg`
- **Windows** — `zeron-<version>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`
- **Linux** — `zeron-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`, then run its `install.sh`

No account or network connection is needed; sessions stay on your device. The app updates itself.

### Open a project from the terminal

```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
zeron            # this folder, or: zeron <path>
```

Zeron opens on the new-session canvas with that project selected. If it is already running, the running window switches instead of a second one opening. The Windows installer puts `zeron` on the PATH; on macOS use **Zeron → Install 'zeron' Command…**; the Linux installers link `~/.local/bin/zeron`.

## Headless (CLI)

For servers and other machines without a display, such as a VPS that keeps agents running after you close your laptop. Linux only:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zeron.sh/install.sh | sh
zeron status
```

The installer starts the engine as a background service that survives reboots.

```bash
zeron status      # local/synced mode and engine status
zeron update      # update to the latest release
zeron daemon start|stop|restart|status
```

## Multi-device sync (optional)

Sign in to start an agent on one device and follow or drive it from another:

```bash
zeron daemon stop
zeron login        # or: zeron logout to return to local-only
zeron daemon start
```

Devices signed in to the same account can read and write each other's workspace files, so only sign in devices you trust. Existing local sessions are never uploaded.
