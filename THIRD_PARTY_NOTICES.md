## Native browser host

The macOS browser uses [Wry 0.56.0](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/tree/wry-v0.56.0)
(MIT OR Apache-2.0) to host the system WebKit engine, with the `objc2` family
of bindings (MIT) and `block2` (MIT). Exact versions and transitive dependencies
are pinned in `Cargo.lock`. The browser integration is independently written
Zeron code.

The Zui native overlay renderer adapts Apache-2.0 GPUI code from
[`egoist/zed` at `57bd4fe`](https://github.com/egoist/zed/tree/57bd4fe181639797d395978d5de17bc9e10a6219/crates/gpui_macos).
Attribution is retained in the pinned Zui dependency’s `NOTICE`.
